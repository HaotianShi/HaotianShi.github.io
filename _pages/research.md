The rapid advancement of communication, vehicle automation technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming intelligent transportation systems (ITS), offering opportunities to enhance safety, efficiency, and energy. Motivated by these developments, my research focuses on 1) interactive driving behavior modeling and prediction, 2) optimal control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic environments, and 3) traffic management for urban, rural, and tribal regions. My research philosophy hinges on addressing challenges in these areas by integrating traditional analytical methods, such as physics-based modeling, control theory, and traffic flow theory, with emerging technologies like machine learning (ML) and foundation models (FMs)/large language models (LLMs). In line with my research philosophy, I have developed generic and interpretable methodological frameworks and computational models to analyze and improve transportation system performance in terms of mobility, safety, stability, and energy consumption. These models are validated through field implementations using Level 3 CAVs.

## Major Research Areas <br>
Over the years, I have investigated the following three broad areas of research: 1) interactive driving behavior modeling and prediction, 2) optimal control of connected and automated vehicles (CAV) in mixed traffic environments, and 3) traffic management for urban, rural, and tribal regions. A selection of my papers is provided in the reference section for further reading. 

### 1 Interactive driving behavior modeling and prediction
With the integration of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and CAVs, the dynamics of mixed traffic flows have shifted significantly compared to traditional traffic conditions. In mixed traffic, human-driven vehicle (HV) behaviors exhibit greater variability and uncertainty, particularly in longitudinal car-following and lateral maneuvers. These factors heighten traffic safety risks and complicate the decision-making processes of AVs. To address these challenges, we have developed novel modeling and prediction methodologies for both AVs and HVs, focusing on longitudinal and lateral driving behaviors. These methodologies leverage approaches including physics-based models, machine learning (ML), physics-informed machine learning (PIML), and foundation models (FMs)/large language models (LLMs).

### 1.1  Multi-scale car-following and traffic dynamics modeling methodologies
In a mixed traffic environment, it is crucial to model and accurately calibrate car-following behaviors of both HVs and AVs. This provides critical information about the driving characteristics of surrounding vehicles for CAVs to optimize their decision-making processes. However, current car-following models based on either physics or ML often struggle to accurately capture the uncertainty in driving behaviors and typically overlook the influence of macroscopic traffic flow (traffic dynamics) on individual driving behaviors. In this regard, We have developed models using both physics-based approaches and ML techniques.

### 1.2  Interaction-aware two-dimensional (2D) trajectory prediction 
Accurate prediction of human-driven vehicle trajectories is essential for decision-making and control in CAVs. In dynamic and complex environments, vehicle behavior is influenced by its own historical actions and interactions with surrounding vehicles, which complicates the precise prediction of future longitudinal and lateral movements. To address this challenge, we proposed [Graph-based Interaction-aware Multimodal Trajectory Prediction (GIMTP)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10352973/) and Relational [Hypergraph Interaction-informed Neural mOtion generator (RHINO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11676) methodologies. GIMTP constructs a dynamic adjacency matrix to capture vehicle interactions comprehensively and leverages a Diffusion Graph Convolutional Network (DGCN) to model the evolving relationship between past and future states. RHINO leverages hypergraph-based relational reasoning by integrating a multi-scale hypergraph neural network to model group-wise interactions among multiple vehicles and their multimodal driving behaviors, thereby enhancing motion prediction accuracy and reliability. Using the probabilistic frameworks, GIMTP and RHINO accurately predict future driving intentions (e.g., going straight, left lane change, right lane change) and the two-dimensional longitudinal and lateral trajectory over a time horizon of several seconds. 

Moreover, we introduce the [Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S277242472500006X) framework, a novel approach blending physics models with neural networks to predict system states, particularly in complex environments like oscillated vehicle trajectory and road traffic dynamics. PERL enhances a physics model's prediction by adding a corrective residual derived from an NN model, thereby leveraging the interpretability and accuracy of NN models.  


### 1.3  Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enabled prediction and planning for autonomous driving
Motivated by the emergent reasoning capabilities of LLMs and VLMs, I focus on the application of VLMs in enhancing prediction and planning for autonomous driving, leveraging their multimodal understanding to improve decision-making and safety. One of the key frameworks we have developed is [V2X-VLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09251), an end-to-end (E2E) vehicle-infrastructure cooperative autonomous driving system that integrates Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication and VLMs. This system enhances situational awareness and trajectory prediction by fusing data from vehicle-mounted cameras, infrastructure sensors, and textual descriptions. Contrastive learning is utilized to refine feature discrimination further, enabling the model to interpret the driving environment robustly. In parallel, we have explored the integration of model-based planning with VLMs through the [VLM-MPC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04821) framework. This system combines VLMs' reasoning abilities with a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to create a closed-loop planning mechanism. The VLM generates high-level driving parameters, which the MPC uses to execute real-time vehicle planning while accounting for factors like engine lag and state feedback. Tested on the nuScenes dataset, VLM-MPC has been shown to enhance driving smoothness and safety across various scenarios significantly.

### 2  Optimal control of CAVs in mixed traffic environments
To address the challenges posed by the stochastic nature of human-driven behaviors, the heterogeneity in traffic composition, and the partial observability characteristic of complex mixed traffic conditions involving both CAVs and HVs, optimizing CAV driving behavior from a systemic traffic flow perspective remains particularly difficult. In response to these challenges, we have conducted extensive research on decision-making control for CAVs in mixed traffic environments. By integrating the core principles of physics models, control theory, and traffic flow theory into a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, I developed the physics-informed deep reinforcement learning (PIDRL) methodology, specifically designed for the intelligent control of CAVs and other ITS agents in mixed traffic scenarios. This generic methodology has proven versatile and effective in various applications, including CAV control and intelligent bus operations. It has been validated in improving key system-level performance metrics such as safety, efficiency, stability, and energy utilization.

### 2.1  Centralized multi-objective cooperative control for CAVs
A [centralized multi-objective cooperative control strategy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0968090X21004150) based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to address the heterogeneity of mixed traffic flow. This approach decomposes the mixed traffic flow into multiple subsystem types, accommodating any heterogeneous combination of traffic fleets. Within each subsystem, targeted multi-objective cooperative control regarding safety, energy, and stability is applied to CAVs, enabling local optimization of the mixed traffic flow. Compared to advanced MPC and linear/nonlinear control methods, the proposed CAV control model significantly improves system stability, energy, safety, and mobility.

### 2.2  Distributed CAV control strategy considering communication loss
In response to the partial observability of mixed traffic flow and the stochastic nature of HV behavior, we propose a novel [distributed control strategy for CAVs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0968090X23000086) based on physics-informed DRL, offering a more practical implementation than centralized controllers. This work uniquely integrates traffic flow theory with consensus and equilibrium theories from control science within the DRL framework. Such integration enables a fusion of macroscopic traffic flow characteristics and multi-vehicle state data, effectively mitigating the stochastic nature of HDV behavior and reducing the propagation of traffic oscillations in mixed traffic flow. Furthermore, the proposed strategy [addresses the issue of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication loss](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mice.12825) by introducing a dynamic information flow fusion method, which mitigates the impact of communication disruptions. As a result, the approach significantly enhances traffic flow stability, safety, and efficiency across a wide range of traffic scenarios, including emergency situations.

Additionally, I have extended this generic framework from one-dimensional longitudinal control to a [two-dimensional car-following control strategy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950705123002356) and a [predictive lane-changing control framework](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10988662). Given the inherent randomness of dynamic traffic environments and the variability of two-dimensional road curvatures, the two-dimensional car-following control addresses both car-following and lane-keeping strategies within a curvilinear coordinate system. This approach decomposes driving behaviors into longitudinal "string" behaviors and lateral "local" behaviors, offering a refined control mechanism for complex traffic scenarios. Through V2X communication, this physics-informed learning-based CAV control framework integrates traffic flow data with road geometry, optimizing CAV driving behaviors. Following the model development and simulations, we validated their field implementation, focusing on Level 3 CAVs to validate their practical applications. Our proposed model is applied to the CAV validating the superior performances regarding traffic oscillation dampening, safety, and fuel efficiency. 
 
### 2.3  Distributed dynamics bus control for reducing bus bunching 
We further extended the generic physics-informed control approach to develop [dynamic control systems for buses](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mice.12803). To mitigate the issue of bus bunching, which arises from uncertain travel times and fluctuating passenger demand, we proposed a dynamic control strategy for buses based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). This strategy incorporates both historical and real-time traffic data to optimize bus operations. By improving the accuracy of schedules and maintaining consistent intervals between buses, the [proposed method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952197624001441) effectively reduces deviations in timetables and bus spacing, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and stability of the transit system.

### 3  Traffic management for urban, rural, and tribal regions
In addition to the above-emerging technologies for microscopic CAV and ITS modeling, prediction, and control, my research extends to traffic management strategies for diverse regions, including urban, rural, and tribal areas. This work involves developing traffic control solutions for mixed road networks, recovering traffic flow data in large-scale urban systems, and enhancing safety programs for tribal and rural regions.

### 3.1  Traffic control and network design strategies for mixed urban and expressway systems
Regarding urban traffic management, we have explored [strategies for mitigating congestion in mixed road networks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mice.13435) that combine expressways and arterial roads. By employing traffic models such as the multi-class cell transmission model (CTM) and the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD), we aim to enhance coordination between these interconnected systems. We developed an integrated approach using route guidance, perimeter control, and ramp metering within a model predictive control (MPC) framework, which has proven effective in reducing congestion by optimizing traffic flow across expressways and arterial networks. Additionally, we propose a [cooperative flow‑control strategy for large‑scale urban networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11045413/) that seamlessly links expressways and surface streets. The approach couples a multi‑class cell transmission model for expressways with an MFD‑based representation of urban regions, so vehicles can be tracked across the entire network. A demand‑responsive route‑choice module assigns new trips, while perimeter control balances region‑to‑region transfers and ramp metering tempers expressway inflows—all coordinated by model‑predictive control.

### 3.2  Traffic flow recovery for large-scale urban transportation network
To address the challenge of recovering accurate and high-resolution traffic flow data in large-scale urban transportation networks with limited sensor coverage, we developed the [Analytical Optimized Recovery (AOR) framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03906). This method leverages widely available GPS speed data combined with sparse traffic flow observations to reconstruct comprehensive traffic flow patterns. By formulating a constrained optimization problem with a quadratic objective function and using Lagrangian relaxation to enforce non-negativity constraints, the AOR framework effectively recovers traffic flow data. This approach is validated through simulations on calibrated Shenzhen's urban network using SUMO.

### 3.3  Traffic safety analysis and improvement in tribal and rural areas
In addition to my focus on urban traffic management, we also aim to address the pressing need for improved transportation safety programs in tribal lands, which typically experience higher crash rates and severities. My research concentrates on [enhancing tribal crash reporting and data quality](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/9780784484333.005), which is essential for identifying high-risk locations and developing effective safety programs. Using the Wisconsin police crash report, the study validates the effectiveness of specific tribal data elements, such as location, jurisdiction, and law enforcement agency. The findings reveal the necessity for establishing an independent subcategory in national crash classification systems for tribal data and creating a distinct tribal road type within roadway data elements to enhance data quality for safety analyses in tribal areas. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive [tribal crash analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08177), utilizing a dashboard prototype for statistical performance measurement and monitoring of safety trends in tribal lands. This dashboard, demonstrated with Wisconsin tribal crash data, effectively identifies high-risk areas and compares tribal crashes with statewide data based on severity and type. The research highlights the importance of high-quality, spatially referenced crash data and proposes a reproducible, data-driven approach to enhance tribal safety programs.
